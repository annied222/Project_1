# Movies: To Spend or Not To Spend

## Does a movie's budget have an impact a movie's outcome, gross income or rating?

To figure out weather or not there is a relationship between a movie's gross income and that movie's production budget there were questions that needed to be answered. These questions were developed in order to look directly at the budget vs income relationship, but also to look at other factors that may have an impact on a movie's income. The questions are as the precide below along with the correlating notebook.

### Is there a correlation between a movie's budget and the domestic/worldwide gross?

### How does a production's budget break down in per genre, and does have an impact on the worldwide or domestic gross?

### Will a movie's production budget be reflected in the ratings of that movie? 

### Does the director affect the gross outcome or does the budget? (directors.ipynb)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Based upon the analysis that was done it can be said that the number of movies that a director has done, or the director’s experience, does affect the gross domestic outcome more so than the production budget, but only to a point. That point happens to be when the average budget decreases and outweighs the director’s experience. In the worldwide gross does not appear to be affected by a director's experience, but does have the same result as the gross domestic. As the average budget decreases there is a higher likelihood of a high percent change. It is understandable for there to be a difference between the gross domestic and worldwide outcome. Majority of the movies and directors on this dataset are English speaking and/or American movies. On the domestic (American) side these directors would be known in the United States and would probably be sought out. Worldwide, these directors might not be known, so the director wouldn’t affect the gross outcome. Overall, yes, the direct does affect the gross outcome domestically, but it does not worldwide.

### Is there a difference among studios and the production budget?
